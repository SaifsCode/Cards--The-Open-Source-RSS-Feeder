# Free-RSS-HTML-Feed-puller
Here is the code I wrote with the help of Neo, my personalised OpenAI 4.5, for my company's website hosted by GoDaddy. This pulls RSS feeds directly from URLs. It loads cards in stacks of 15 with maximum of 60, update intreval of every 30 minutes. Feel free to edit the code to your style and preferrence.
